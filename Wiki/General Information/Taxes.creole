==Purchase Tax==
Purchase tax is applied when items are purchased in dynamic pricing mode.  If the tax rate were 3%, the tax charged for the purchase will be 3% of the purchase price.

==Initial Tax==
Initial tax is applied when items are purchased in initial pricing mode.  It works just like purchase tax.

==Static Tax==
Static tax is applied when items are purchased in static pricing mode.  Any item in static pricing mode will use the static tax rate.  Static tax overrides all other purchase tax types. 

==Enchantment Tax==
Enchantment tax is applied when enchantments are purchased.  Enchantment tax will apply to all enchantments unless they are in static pricing mode.

==Sales Tax==
Sales tax has two modes, regular or dynamic.  Regular mode operates just like purchase taxes except it's charged for sales.
