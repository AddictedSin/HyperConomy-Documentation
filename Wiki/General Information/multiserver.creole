Multi server mode allows HyperConomy to share players, banks, trade objects, and shops between multiple servers.  This is useful for some setups such as BungeeCord.  To use this feature set multi-server.enable to true in config.yml.  Which features are synced can also be controlled in config.yml.  The update interval setting controls how often data is synced between servers.  It's measured in milliseconds so if you set it to 3000 that would mean it will update every 3 seconds.  

==2 Server Config Setup Example==
Server 1 has Minecraft IP 127.0.0.1 running on port 3313, server 2 has the same IP with Minecraft on port 3314

===Server 1===
remote-server-ip-addresses: 127.0.0.1,3314;

port: 3313

===Server 2===
remote-server-ip-addresses: 127.0.0.1,3313;

port: 3314


==3 Server Config Setup Example==
Server 1 runs on IP 127.0.0.2:3313, while the other two servers run on 127.0.0.1 ports 3313 and 3314

====Server 1====
remote-server-ip-addresses: 127.0.0.1,3313;127.0.0.1,3314;

port: 3313

====Server 2====
remote-server-ip-addresses: 127.0.0.2,3313;127.0.0.1,3314;

port: 3313

====Server 3====
remote-server-ip-addresses: 127.0.0.2,3313;127.0.0.1,3313;

port: 3314

==Additional Servers==
If you have more servers just add them to each of the other servers' configs in the same manner as above.  Essentially each server's config must point to all other servers.
